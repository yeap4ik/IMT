    <h1>Review of the Logitech g pro wireless gaming mouse</h1>
    <p>
      I bought this gaming mouse 2 years ago, on sale from Amazon; the product arrived quickly enough, safe and sound
      <br><br>
      The experience of using it is mostly positive.
      <br>
      The battery life of Logitech mice is always excellent and stands out from other brands of wireless mice, all thanks to the branded HERO sensor, the mouse, with moderate use, needs to be charged once every 3 weeks, which is a high figure compared to other mice.
      <br><br>
      The switches are also flawless, amron for 50 million clicks.
      <br>
      If you read other reviews, then in the first batches there were often defects in these switches, but over time, this problem was eliminated.
      <br><br>
      The coating has polished a little over time, in places of frequent contact with fingers, but overall it is decent and has not worn off or peeled off in 2 years.
      <br><br>
      Cons:
      After a year of use, the wheel encoder stopped working, scrolling became impossible, when scrolling down the wheel, the page went up and down and jumped in every possible way. To fix this, it was necessary to order a new encoder from aliexpress, I chose TTC GOLD, after successfully re-soldering the encoder, the mouse became completely functional and it was still pleasant to use.
      <br><br>
      To summarize:
      If you do not count the broken encoder and the need to replace it, then there are no disadvantages in this gaming mouse. Good assembly, relatively light weight (72 grams), good battery life, excellent sensor, excellent switches and good ergonomics of the mouse.
      <br><br>
      In general, looking at 2025, this mouse is still a good and high-quality choice if you need a wireless mouse for the office and gaming.
