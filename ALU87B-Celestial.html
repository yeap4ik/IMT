            <br>
            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>
                Dark Project ALU87B Celestial is an incredibly beautiful and impressively quiet keyboard built on G3MS Voidstone switches, which come factory-lubed. As a result, typing on this keyboard is a real pleasure—it's incredibly quiet, and the typing experience is very satisfying. This is further enhanced by its attractive and eye-catching design.
                <br><br>
                The keyboard also features factory-lubed Cherry-style stabilizers. It supports hot-swap technology, so there's no need to desolder switches—just pull one out and insert another.
                That would have been the whole story with this keyboard—ALU87B Celestial—as I had only used it for about a week.
                <br><br>
                However, after a month of use, one drawback became apparent: the stabilizer on the spacebar started to make a noticeable rattling noise. The factory lubrication doesn't help much in this case, which is disappointing—especially for a keyboard marketed as "silent."
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Beautiful design: Attractive and eye-catching aesthetics.</li>

                <li>Very quiet: Impressively silent during typing.</li>

                <li>Pleasant typing experience: Typing feels satisfying and enjoyable.</li>

                <li>Factory-lubed G3MS Voidstone switches: Smooth out of the box.</li>

                <li>Factory-lubed Cherry-style stabilizers: Enhance keystroke stability.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Spacebar stabilizer rattle: Noticeable rattling noise appeared after a month of use.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the author is satisfied with the keyboard overall, but it's not perfect due to the discovered flaw.
